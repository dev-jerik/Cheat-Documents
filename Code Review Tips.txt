How to code review
1. read redmine specs and make sure it follows the specs
Process to check
1. database
  - make sure to also add it to clean_up_setup or clean_up_txn
  - add it to clean_up if it is the default, for easier use
2. domain
  - check annotations
  - not null message
  - check datetime, should be joda in getmethod
  - if the field is object make sure to add additional annotation @Valid
3. dao and Service
  - @Repository
  - make sure to follow coding standard / naming standard
  - make sure names are easy to understand
  - check class name and method names
  - setups doesnt have delete
  - transactions sometimes can be editable and sometimes its not  
  - train wreck maximum is 2 dots
  - create variables for codes that are repeated multiple times
  - string query should have escape special characters  
  - use query.setparameter only for wrapper class(*not primitive classes that we didnt create)
  - use setInteger, or setLong for wrapper classes
  - for txn that have manipulates database, it should have auditlog
  - validateSave should only validate the fields inputed by the user
  - validateFinal should validate all required, programmer inputed included
4. service
  - make sure to call the dao version of methods
  - @Service  
5. models
  - if the domain is header/main object, it should extends CptiLdm
  - for special object like Profile, which need to have special method 
    such as getCorporate and getIndividual it should extends CptiModel
  - detail class usually do not extend CptiBaseClass
  - detail class models does not have main model, and it has list model
  - make sure that fields that is used on component should have models
6. data provider
  - 
7. data table column generator
8. pages
  - title
  - check the labels used
  - check labels and component name
  - check if the page validates properly
  - edit page should use evict() after getobject() and before you validate onsubmit
  - delete reuses the view page
9. panels
  - 
10. report
  - new object should have a new report
11. labels.properties 
  - object name
  - object name setup
  - make sure that already used "string" should just refer to other labels  

Others 
- indention
- should be easy to understand
- very long process should be put in method, even if it is only used once, just for readability

- git log --grep="any text" 
  - this would search for the log that contains the text in all the commits
- git log --author="any author"
  - show all the commits of the author
